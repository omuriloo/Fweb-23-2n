        <h1>The Scream</h1>
        <p>The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is the popular name given to each of four versions of a 
            composition, created as both paintings and pastels, by Norwegian Expressionist artist 
            Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910. The German title Munch gave these works is Der Schrei 
            der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The works show a figure with an agonized expression 
            against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow has described The Scream 
            as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."

            Edvard Munch created the four versions in various media. The National Gallery in Oslo, 
            Norway, holds one of two painted versions (1893, shown here). The Munch Museum holds the 
            other painted version (1910, see gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893.</p>
